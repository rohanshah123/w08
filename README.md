## Cross origin requests (CORS)

In Chrome, you will likely get an error (depending on your settings):

> Failed to load https://developer.mozilla.org/: Redirect from 'https://developer.mozilla.org/' to 'https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.

Open with Firefox instead.
